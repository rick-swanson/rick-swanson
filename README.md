- 👋 Hi, I’m @rick-swanson
- 👀 I’m interested in Modularisation and Refactoring, and architecture. I can do new features, but I prefer architecture. I also used to be a tester, and like well tested software, and am an advocate for improved accessibility of the app.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Combine, just every slowly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reachitecting the app and improving accessibility.
- 📫 How to reach me - through slack
